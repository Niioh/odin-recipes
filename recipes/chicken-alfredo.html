<h2>This version of chicken fettuccine alfredo is lightened by
substituting some of the heavy cream with chicken broth. </h2>
<h4>Ingredients: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
    <li>1 sprig chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 cups freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, divided</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps: </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat 
        to low; simmer for 5 minutes. Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the 
        cover on for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is 
        cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size slices.</li>
    <li>Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup.</li>
    <li>Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth; bring to a simmer and remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly 
        incorporated; repeat until about 1/2 cup of the warm cream mixture is used.</li>
    <li>Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, 
        whisking constantly, until the mixture almost comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black 
        pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly 
        cooked through, about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a 
        few minutes until thick.</li>
    <li>Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to serve.</li>
